                feedback) until they complete a certified professional draft. SEM:ANTICS also records all 
                changes after each draft writing, so after completion, the user can review it at any time and 
                see how they have improved. SEM:ANTICS leverages <b>Cohere's LLM models fine-tuned using a team-compiled

              <p>
                On January 5th 2022, the Ontario government ordered an issue that all non-urgent surgeries were 
                to be paused. Due to the third wave of COVID-19, Ontario is facing another crisis of staffing 
                shortages in hospitals because many of the health-care workers are either infected or are isolated. 
                This marks the third time; on June 13, 2020 and April 8th 2021 a similar order was also issued. 
                With data from 2020, it was after the first wave that Ontario was already 148 364 surgies behind.
                  The data revealing the amount of surgery backlog for Ontario 2021 has yet to be released publicly.
              </p>
              <p>
                The web infrastructure from the Ontario government is unclear, non-specific and requires users to fill 
                in extra information, visit multiple websites and search for hospital contact information. This project was 
                built to provide a single dashboard that give users all the information they need to access the healthcare they need.
              </p>
              <p>
                We web scraped Ontario Health and the Toronto Hospital's websites using the following <b>python 
                libraries: selenium, beautiful soup and requests</b>. We then made this data accessible through a user 
                friendly web interface, built using <b>React</b>, which allows users to search hospitals by surgery and 
                view information about wait times. We also utilized the <b>Google Maps API</b> to order the result by distance to the user.

                Developed with a team of three in <b>36 hours</b> for 
                <b>DeltaHacks 2022</b>, Interviewy is an <b>Artificial Intelligence</b> based interface
                that allows users to practice their interview skills by
                providing them an analysis of their video recorded interview
                based on their selected interview question. Users can reflect on
                their confidence levels and covered topics by selecting a
                specific time-stamp in their report. An abundance of qualified applicants lose their chance to secure
                their dream job simply because they are unable to effectively
                present their knowledge and skills when it comes to the
                interview. The transformation of interviews into the virtual
                format due to the Covid-19 pandemic has created many challenges
                for the applicants, especially students as they have reduced
                access to in-person resources where they could develop their
                interview skills. This Interface was built using the <b>MERN stack</b>. In the
                backend we used the AssemblyAI APIs for monitoring the
                confidence levels and covered topics.

                Developed with a team of three in <b>36 hours</b> at QWER Hacks 2022, 
                STDetector is <b>mobile app</b> that facilitates the sharing of
                sexual health information among people. Upon signing up, you can
                enter your sexual health information and upload pictures of your
                lab tests as proof. Once that’s locked in, you can search for
                your partner’s username and start a connection request. Upon
                accepting your request, you and your partner will exchange
                sexual health information at a glance. Sexually transmitted infections are very common and costly to a
                nation’s health and economy. 1 in 5 people in the US have an STI
                and almost half of new STIs were among youth aged 18-24.
                Additionally, most STIs have no signs of symptoms. The only way
                to know is to get tested. Not to mention, once you know your
                status, you might want to share that information with
                prospective partners.

                The main character of this tower climbing game is a slime creature who uses its mass to propel themself upward,
                or to attack enemy ghosts. The main game mechanic revolves around the theme of the game jam, <b>"sacrifice"</b>. 
                Players must guide slime dude to the top of the tower in order to win. They can sacrifice parts of their size
                and mass, in order to jump higher, or to attack enemies. However, if they lose too much mass, the game will end.

              <p>
                Onionshop, my favourite course project from my time studying at U of T, is a drawing program built from scratch, using <b>Object Oriented Programming</b> and <b>SOLID design principles</b>. 
                Onionshop is an original project developed entirely by me and 5 of my peers at the time.

                Drawings can be saved to files with the extension .onion, and reopened later to continue editing. Users can choose between different drawing tools from the toolbar, including pen, eraser, and shape tools. The shape tools include line, rectangle, 
                and circle. When the user selects the Pen, they can press and hold down the left mouse button, this should result in a line appearing on the canvas 
                tracing the path of the mouse movements on the canvas. The Eraser tool works similar to the pen tool, but erases the content at a specified position 
                on the canvas. The Shape tool can draw specific shapes at user specified positions. After selecting the shape, users start creating the shape by clicking 
                the left mouse button on the canvas and adjusting the size and orientation of the shape by holding and dragging the mouse. For every kind of tool, users can 
                select the color and brush size. The canvas could have multiple layers, each layer is essentially a separate drawing that does not affect other layers. But when every layer is visible, they stack 
                together and create the whole drawing. Users can choose between different existing layers, or add new layers. Each layer can be shown or hidden.
